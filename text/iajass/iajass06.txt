In Arabic Sphinx means “father of terror”. The Sphinx of Giza is 73 meters long, 21 meters tall
and its face is 5 meters wide. The Sphinx is magnificent with its solemn expression staring far
away. The statue is sitting west to east, crouched beside the tomb of Khafra. Almost every visitor
who comes here will take a dislocated photo of “kissing” the Sphinx. In addition, you can shoot a
variety of photos like leaning against or kissing pyramids.
