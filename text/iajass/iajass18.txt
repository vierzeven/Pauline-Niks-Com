Manneken Pis is located in Rue de L’Étuve, near the Grand Place of downtown Brussels. It
was created by the great sculptor Jerome Duquesnoy in 1610. The 50-centimeter high sculpture
depicts a naked boy with curly hair and a turned-up nose. He urinates all the time, smiling and
standing with his arms akimbo and his belly sticking out.
