The Eiffel Tower is now the symbol of Paris and even France. Every day ten thousands of
tourists go up to enjoy the Paris scenery. Of course, taking silly pictures is not the only thing you
can do high up in the tower. If you have enough time, you can have lunch or dinner in the
Michelin star restaurant, but make sure to book well in advance.
