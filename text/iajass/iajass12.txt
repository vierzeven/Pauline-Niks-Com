The Niagara Falls are among the biggest and most famous falls in the world. They are located
at the border of the United States and Canada. The falls consist of three different parts: The
Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal veil Falls. By boat or helicopter trips you
can enjoy the spectacular view. Two nights a week every summer there is a fireworks show on the
water.
