The Golden Gate Bridge, made out of more than 100,000 tons of steel, is the symbol of San
Francisco. The northern shore offers the most panoramic view of the bridge. During sunset the
scenery is magnificent, but to really appreciate the view of and from the bridge, you should
avoid foggy weather. The Golden Gate Bridge is also one of the most famous suicide sites in the
world.
