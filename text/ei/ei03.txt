Winter Willy. Winter version (on skis) The wheels can stay where they are, that way itâ€™s easy to
switch at any time from driving to skiing mode.
The gas springs are probably being attached to the wooden construction of the bicycle wheels.
The skis are attached to the gas springs (shocks will be captured and you will be able to hang sideways
when you make a turn)
