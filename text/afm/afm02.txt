On 17 April 2017 Jörg Sprave got a police anti-riot shield to test his most powerful homemade
air gun, shooting a steel arrow with 150 times the pressure of a car tire. The gun is officially
not considered a gun because the projectile goes over the barrel rather than through it. The arrow
he fired penetrated a triple-layer archery mat, a car door and then the shield. “That air gun has the
energy of a modern hunting rifle and the momentum of an elephant gun.”
